Hello
My name is Karndeep Chouhan
and this is my game called
"Frog & Human: Bro's for life"
How to play:
left arrow key and right arrow key to move player left and right.
Spacebar makes player jump.
Avoid traps and make it to the end to get the trophy.
hitting traps kills the player and makes you restet the level.
(Please delete "SampleScene" in Scene folder before playing to make the game work well.)
Thank you for your time.
